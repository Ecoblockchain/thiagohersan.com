Part performance, part product, part continuation of a previous project.</p>
<p>While Angry Letters dealt with the materialization of anger, this is the materialization of secrets. While in San Francisco, I recorded myself reading my favorite parts from NDA(link?) documents of different tech companies based in the greater Silicon Valley region. Most of them self-referential: rules and rules regarding the document itself. The waveforms from these recorded secrets were then converted into shapes that were inscribed on the inside of 3D-printed plastic eggs.</p>
<p>I tried to hide these eggs back inside chickens, but none of the ones I had agreed to help me. I am obviously kidding, and no chickens were harmed or involved in the making of this project.</p>
