I used to design circuits and improve semiconductor manufacturing technologies.

In 2012 I was the technical coordinator at [Marginalia+Lab](https://vimeo.com/marginalialab), the art and technology space for creation and research in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

During that time I was also involved with the art and technology residency program at the [Museum of Image and Sound](http://www.labmis.org.br/) in São Paulo, Brazil; and with [Nuvem](https://nuvem.tk/), the rural residency space in Resende, Brazil.

More recently, I worked as a design-engineer at [BeatBots](https://www.behance.net/beatbots) in San Francisco, where we prototyped interactive robotic toys, and other things.

And, in 2015, I helped start and run [FACTLab](http://alab.space/), as a Researcher in Residence at FACT in Liverpool.

I’m part of [Astrovandalistas](http://www.astrovandalistas.cc/base/), an art+tech+activism collective based in Mexico City, whose work is primarily focused on coming up with interfaces for enhancing human-human interaction.
