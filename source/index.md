I used to design circuits and improve semiconductor manufacturing technologies.

In 2012 I was the technical coordinator at <a href="https://vimeo.com/marginalialab">Marginalia+Lab</a>, the art and technology space for creation and research in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

During that time I was also involved with the art and technology residency program at the <a href="http://www.mis-sp.org.br/labmis">Museum of Image and Sound</a> in São Paulo, Brazil; and with <a href="https://nuvem.tk/">Nuvem</a>, the rural residency space in Resende, Brazil.

More recently, I worked as a design-engineer at <a href="https://www.behance.net/beatbots">BeatBots</a> in San Francisco, where we prototyped interactive robotic toys, and other things.

And, in 2015, I helped start and run <a href="http://alab.space/">FACTLab</a>, as a Researcher in Residence at FACT in Liverpool.

I’m part of <a href="http://www.astrovandalistas.cc/base/">Astrovandalistas</a>, an art+tech+activism collective based in Mexico City, whose work is primarily focused on coming up with interfaces for enhancing human-human interaction.
