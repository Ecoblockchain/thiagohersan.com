I used to design circuits and improve semiconductor manufacturing technologies.

In 2012 I was the technical coordinator at Marginalia+Lab, the art and technology space for creation and research in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

During that time I was also involved with the art and technology residency program at the Museum of Image and Sound in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; and with Nuvem, the rural residency space in Resende, Brazil.

More recently, I worked as a design-engineer at BeatBots in San Francisco, where we prototyped interactive robotic toys, and other things.

And, in 2015, I helped start and run FACTLab, as a Researcher in Residence at FACT in Liverpool.
