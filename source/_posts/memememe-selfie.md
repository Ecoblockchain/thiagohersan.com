*without conversation, there is no self-and-other* - [Paul Pangaro](http://www.pangaro.com/published/cyb-and-con.html)

If conversation and identity arise together, as proposed by Gordon Paskâ€™s Conversation Theory, what are the consequences (or limitations) of communicating without an other? Can we just as easily construct our identity and our environment while talking to ourselves? What is the sound of a one-sided conversation?

memememe#selfie is a set of sculptures that explores some of these questions, in the context of our contemporary preoccupation with trending, liking, following, etc. It might be the first instance of artificial unintelligence: phones that take selfies of themselves using mirrors or each other as mirror.

It is also the first steps in the development of a physical communication protocol. Before being able to commune with each other, it is important for the cellphones to recognize themselves and confront the duality of self/other.

Residues of their one-sided conversation can be seen on their [tumblr](http://memememeselfie.tumblr.com/) [feeds](http://memememe2memememe.tumblr.com/).
