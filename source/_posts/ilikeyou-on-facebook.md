Anyone who understands big data will agree that: 

![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) = ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/heart.png)

iLikeYou (on facebook) is a web app designed to help us quantify our feelings towards each other. It goes through facebook data and tries to ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) every post, picture and comment published by, or tagged with, a chosen friend.

Much like real love, the amount of data you can actually ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) using this app is determined by the other person's privacy settings and how much they trust you.
