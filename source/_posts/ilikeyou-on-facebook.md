Anyone who understands big data will agree that: 

![](like.png) + ![](like.png) + ![](like.png) + ![](like.png) + ![](like.png) = ![](heart.png)

iLikeYou (on facebook) is a web app designed to help us quantify our feelings towards each other. It goes through facebook data and tries to ![](like.png) every post, picture and comment published by, or tagged with, a chosen friend.

Much like real love, the amount of data you can actually ![](like.png) using this app is determined by the other person's privacy settings and how much they trust you.
