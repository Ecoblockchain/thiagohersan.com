[Ongoing project](http://www.memememememememe.me) with Radamés Ajna, where we are investigating what happens when the tools we use to communicate start to have more fun than we do, while communicating.

This project was awarded a [VIDA 15.0 production incentive award](http://vida.fundaciontelefonica.com/en/projects/vida-15/), and a [Telefónica I+D](http://www.tid.es/) residency. We are currently researching different methods of interaction, recognition and communication between the phones, and a way to make them keep track of their affective relationships, without relying on digital data transmission.

The first step in the development of a physical communication protocol resulted in a set of sculptures inspired by Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory and Paul Pangaro's work on Interaction. [memememe#selfie](http://www.thiagohersan.com/project/memememeselfie-2014/) explores how we construct our identity and our environment through conversation, and the consequences of one-sided conversation, in the context of our contemporary preoccupation with trending, liking, following, etc.
