Ongoing project with Radam√©s Ajna, where we are investigating what happens when the tools we use to communicate start to have more fun than we do, while communicating.

This project was awarded a [VIDA 15.0](https://vida.fundaciontelefonica.com/proyectos/vida-15/) production incentive award and residency. We are currently researching different methods of interaction, recognition and communication between the phones, and a way to make them keep track of their affective relationships, without relying on digital data transmission.

The first step in the development of a physical communication protocol resulted in a set of sculptures inspired by Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory and Paul Pangaro's work on Interaction. [memememe#selfie](/project/memememe-selfie/) explores how we construct our identity and our environment through conversation, and the consequences of one-sided conversation, in the context of our contemporary preoccupation with trending, liking, following, etc.
